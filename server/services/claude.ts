Make sure your recommendations are practical, detailed, and directly address their specific situation and preferences. Consider factors like:
- Time constraints between arrival and next stop
- Energy level and tiredness after travel
- Budget vs comfort trade-offs
- Luggage handling logistics
- Local transportation options
- Time of day considerations`;
